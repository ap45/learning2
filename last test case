Thank you for not just being colleagues in a corporate world but friends I've cherished and will cherish for a lifetime. 

As I sit down to write this farewell message, I can’t help but feel a mix of emotions. It’s like trying to write the perfect ending to a fantastic book—you just don’t want it to end! But here I am, penning down my thoughts and memories with a heart full of gratitude and a hint of sadness.

First off, thank you for all the incredible memories we've made together. From all the amazing parties that turned into unforgettable nights to the endless coffee breaks where we shared our dreams, fears, and everything in between, every moment has been a joy. The impromptu meets where we laughed till our stomachs hurt, the serious discussions that led to brilliant ideas, and the simple everyday interactions that made work feel like home—all of these moments will be treasured.

Your support and camaraderie have made even the toughest days easier and the good days even better.

It's hard to express how emotional I am writing this message. The decision to move on was not easy because it means leaving behind such an incredible group of people.
