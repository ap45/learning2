This year, my core contributions included working on the UI for both Profile Manager and Investigation Workbench, as well as developing the API for Profile Manager for search and sourcelist management. These contributions had a significant impact on the project. While the product I delivered was not the absolute best, it was considered good given the constraints of time. It addressed the essential needs and improved the workflow for users. Despite some outliers affecting performance, the team's prompt response in fixing issues ensured a better user experience. My achievements this year can be summarized as:
